===============================================================================
SYNOPSIS:

    ./bin/router --cap <cap_file> --net <net_file> --out <output_file>

    This program implements a Global Router using a congestion-aware pathfinding 
    algorithm (Dijkstra's Algorithm) with a Rip-up and Reroute strategy to 
    minimize total overflow and wirelength.

===============================================================================
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

    bin/          
        Contains the executable binary 'router' after compilation.
    
    src/          
        Contains all source C++ codes (.cpp and .h files).
        - main.cpp: Entry point, handles argument parsing and file I/O calls.
        - router.cpp: Core routing logic, including the Rip-up and Reroute loop.
        - grid.cpp: Data structure managing the 3D grid, capacity, and demand.
        - graph.cpp: Implementation of the graph structure and Dijkstra's algorithm.
        - parser.cpp: Handles reading .cap and .net input files.
    
    doc/          
        Contains the project report (report.pdf).
    
    inputs/       
        Place your input test cases (*.cap, *.net) here.
    
    output/       
        Stores the generated routing result files (*.route).
        
    logs/
        Stores execution logs generated by the running script.

    makefile      
        Script for compiling the source code into the binary.

    run.sh
        Automated script to compile, run cases 1-6, and verify results.
===============================================================================
HOW TO COMPILE:

    Under the root directory of this PA, simply type:
    
        make

    This command will compile all source files in 'src/' and generate the 
    executable 'router' inside the 'bin/' directory.

    To clean up compiled files (objects and binary), type:
    
        make clean

===============================================================================
HOW TO RUN:

    1. Manual Execution:
       Change directory to bin/ (or run from root):
       
       ./bin/router --cap <input_cap> --net <input_net> --out <output_route>

       Example:
       ./bin/router --cap inputs/case1.cap --net inputs/case1.net --out output/case1.route

    2. Automated Script:
       A helper script is provided to run all test cases (case1 to case6) and 
       display a statistics table (Time/Overflow).
       
       bash run.sh
